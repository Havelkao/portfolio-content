Hello! My name is Ondra, I create stuff using javascript and python.
My preferred reactive framework is Vue.
For visualizations I like to use d3js and threejs.
CSS is okay, but I don't love it.
Backend-wise, I tend to use either flask or fast-api.
I'm also familiar with the python data science stack and both relational and non-relational databases.
